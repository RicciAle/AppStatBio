#RANDOM VARIABLES EXERCISE

```{r}
library(downloader) 
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleControlsPopulation.csv"
filename <- basename(url)
download(url, destfile=filename)
x <- unlist( read.csv(filename) )
```

Here x represents the weights for the entire population.

#What is the average of these weights?

```{r}
mean(x)
```
Good start!
